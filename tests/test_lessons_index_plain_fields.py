"""The index must carry the optional structured fields (#1783) — and only where a lesson has them.

The defect this file exists for was invisible by construction. `misakanet_search` reads the three
plain fields off the *record*, and there are two sources for that record:

* the **D1 path**, where the row's `frontmatter` column is lifted onto it (#3987/#4013); and
* the **GitHub/KV fallback** (`loadLessons` → `fetchFromGitHub("lessons.json", "data")`), which
  applies **no lift at all** — so the only thing the projection can see is a top-level key on the
  index entry.

`scripts/update_lessons_json.py` picked its fields by hand and never emitted one, so every lesson
lost the three fields on that path. What made it look fine is that `evidence_level` works there
*purely because the generator does emit it* — and the fallback code sitting right beside the plain
fields (`frontmatterField(lesson.frontmatter, …)`) is dead on this path, because no index entry has
a `frontmatter` key at all (measured 0/411). Two neighbouring lines, one working for a reason nobody
had written down, the other inert for the same reason.

These tests are written against the **corpus**, not against a fixture: the expected value is read
back out of the lesson markdown, so a generator that stops emitting the fields, emits the wrong
value, or invents a key for a lesson that has none, all fail. `_PAIRINGS` is counted and the count
asserted, so a broken probe fails loudly instead of passing vacuously.
