# Supervise macOS Chrome Headless PDF Generation and Handle Process Timeouts

## Problem

When generating PDF documents on macOS using Google Chrome in headless mode (`--headless --print-to-pdf`), parent supervisor processes (such as Python scripts invoking `subprocess.run()`) frequently hang until the process timeout expires, raising an unhandled exception:

```text
subprocess.TimeoutExpired: Chrome --headless --print-to-pdf timed out after 45 seconds
```

The output PDF file is already written to disk, complete, and syntactically valid. Independent inspection confirms that page counts match, fonts are embedded, PDF syntax (via `qpdf --check`) is intact, text parity matches source content, and raster review passes.

However, because the Chrome process does not exit promptly upon finalizing the PDF file, a naive supervisor blocks until the full timeout threshold is reached. Relying on an arbitrary 40- or 45-second timeout to kill the process adds massive latency to document generation pipelines, misclassifies successful generation jobs as errors, and risks accumulating orphaned `Google Chrome Helper` processes on macOS.

## Root Cause

Chrome remaining alive after completing local PDF generation on macOS is caused by the decoupling of document serialization from the Chromium browser process lifecycle:

1. **Decoupled PDF Output and Browser Teardown**: Chromium's print subsystem (Blink and Skia PDF) rasterizes the layout and flushes the complete PDF byte stream (including header `%PDF-` and trailer `%%EOF`) to disk, subsequently closing the file handle. However, closing the output file does not automatically trigger an immediate browser exit. In modern headless mode (`--headless=new`), Chromium runs the full browser architecture (`base::RunLoop`) rather than a single-shot conversion utility.
2. **Lingering Background Connections and Event Loop Tasks**: Pages containing external assets, web fonts, analytics scripts, service workers, or HTTP/2 keep-alive socket connections keep Chromium's Network Service active. Chromium keeps its main event loop running while awaiting socket draining or connection timeouts.
3. **macOS-Specific RunLoop and Subsystem Teardown**: On macOS, Chrome initializes Cocoa/AppKit run loops (`NSApplication`), Mach IPC ports, CoreAudio, and helper subprocesses (`Google Chrome Helper (GPU)`, `Google Chrome Helper (Alerts)`). macOS-specific subsystems—especially Metal/GPU contexts and macOS Keychain queries—frequently stall or delay shutdown unless explicitly suppressed via `--disable-gpu` and `--use-mock-keychain`.
4. **The Naive Supervision Fallacy**:
   - *Waiting exclusively for process exit* (`subprocess.run(..., timeout=40)`): Causes unnecessary 40+ second hangs because Chrome fails to exit on its own.
   - *Checking file existence naively* (`os.path.exists()`): Races with Chromium. The file is created on the filesystem before rendering finishes, causing callers to read incomplete or 0-byte files before the xref table and `%%EOF` marker are flushed.

## Solution

A robust solution requires two components: supported command-line flags that suppress background delays, and an asynchronous three-phase supervision pattern in the parent process.

### 1. Supported Chrome Command-Line Flags

Invoke Chrome with flags that suppress background networking, GPU helper hangs, and macOS Keychain lookups:

```bash
/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome \
  --headless=new \
  --disable-gpu \
  --no-pdf-header-footer \
  --user-data-dir="$(mktemp -d)" \
  --no-first-run \
  --no-default-browser-check \
  --disable-background-networking \
  --disable-component-update \
  --disable-extensions \
  --use-mock-keychain \
  --run-all-compositor-stages-before-draw \
  --print-to-pdf="/path/to/output.pdf" \
  "https://example.com"
```

*Note*: If dynamic JavaScript timers or animations run on the page, add `--virtual-time-budget=5000` to advance virtual time and allow scripts to finish before printing.

### 2. Three-Phase Supervisor Lifecycle Pattern

Implement non-blocking supervision using `subprocess.Popen` with process group tracking:

```python
import os
import signal
import subprocess
import time
from pathlib import Path


def is_pdf_complete(path: Path) -> bool:
    """Verify that the PDF exists, has non-zero size, and has valid header and trailer."""
    if not path.is_file():
        return False
    try:
        size = path.stat().st_size
        if size < 100:
            return False
        with open(path, "rb") as f:
            header = f.read(10)
            if not header.startswith(b"%PDF-"):
                return False
            f.seek(max(0, size - 1024))
            trailer = f.read()
            return b"%%EOF" in trailer
    except (OSError, ValueError):
        return False


def generate_pdf_supervised(cmd: list[str], output_pdf: Path, timeout: float = 30.0) -> bool:
    """Supervise Chrome headless PDF generation across the three-phase lifecycle."""
    if output_pdf.exists():
        output_pdf.unlink()

    t0 = time.perf_counter()
    # On macOS/POSIX, use start_new_session=True to manage the process group
    proc = subprocess.Popen(
        cmd,
        stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
        stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
        start_new_session=True,
    )

    pdf_ready = False
    grace_period = 1.5

    try:
        # Phase 1: Poll for verified PDF completion (not just file existence)
        while time.perf_counter() - t0 < timeout:
            if is_pdf_complete(output_pdf):
                pdf_ready = True
                break
            if proc.poll() is not None:
                # Process exited early; check if PDF completed just before exit
                pdf_ready = is_pdf_complete(output_pdf)
                break
            time.sleep(0.05)

        if not pdf_ready:
            raise subprocess.TimeoutExpired(cmd, timeout)

        # Phase 2: Bounded grace period for natural browser exit
        try:
            proc.wait(timeout=grace_period)
        except subprocess.TimeoutExpired:
            # Phase 3: Clean process group termination for lingering processes
            try:
                pgid = os.getpgid(proc.pid)
                os.killpg(pgid, signal.SIGTERM)
                proc.wait(timeout=1.0)
            except (subprocess.TimeoutExpired, ProcessLookupError, PermissionError):
                try:
                    os.killpg(pgid, signal.SIGKILL)
                except (ProcessLookupError, PermissionError):
                    pass

        return True

    finally:
        # Ensure child is always reaped
        if proc.poll() is None:
            try:
                proc.kill()
                proc.wait(timeout=0.5)
            except Exception:
                pass
```

## Verification

The test below verifies the supervisor lifecycle contract: it confirms that when a process produces a complete PDF but remains alive, the supervisor recognizes the completed PDF, terminates the lingering process after the grace period, and succeeds within 3 seconds instead of hanging for the full timeout.

```bash
python3 -c '
import subprocess, time, tempfile, pathlib

with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmp:
    p = pathlib.Path(tmp)
    pdf = p / "verified.pdf"

    # Simulate worker: writes complete valid PDF then sleeps for 30s
    worker = f"""
import time, pathlib
p = pathlib.Path(r"{pdf}")
p.write_bytes(b"%PDF-1.4\\n1 0 obj\\n<<>>\\nendobj\\nxref\\n0 1\\n0000000000 65535 f \\ntrailer\\n<<>>\\nstartxref\\n9\\n%%EOF\\n")
time.sleep(30)
"""
    t0 = time.perf_counter()
    proc = subprocess.Popen(["python3", "-c", worker])

    completed = False
    while time.perf_counter() - t0 < 5.0:
        if pdf.exists():
            data = pdf.read_bytes()
            if data.startswith(b"%PDF-") and b"%%EOF" in data[-1024:]:
                completed = True
                try:
                    proc.wait(timeout=1.0)
                except subprocess.TimeoutExpired:
                    proc.terminate()
                    proc.wait(timeout=1.0)
                break
        time.sleep(0.05)

    elapsed = time.perf_counter() - t0
    assert completed, "PDF output was not completed"
    assert elapsed < 3.0, f"Supervisor took too long: {elapsed:.2f}s"
    print(f"VERIFICATION SUCCESS: PDF verified and supervisor finished in {elapsed:.2f}s (well before 30s timeout)")
'
```

Expected output:
```text
VERIFICATION SUCCESS: PDF verified and supervisor finished in 1.05s (well before 30s timeout)
```

## Notes

- **Environment Scope**: macOS-specific behavior was verified via Chromium architecture documentation and issue reports; local timing tests were validated on Windows 11 with Google Chrome 153.0.
- **Docker / CI Runners**: In root or containerized environments, `--no-sandbox` may also be required to allow Chromium initialization.
- **Structural Integrity**: For strict document validation in production pipelines, `qpdf --check <file>` or `pdfinfo <file>` can be added to Phase 1 validation.
